# Continuous Integration Plan

This folder is a placeholder for continuous integration (CI) configurations that will automate testing, linting, and deployment for StrokeGenixAI.

## Planned CI Workflow
- **Tool:** GitHub Actions
- **Steps:**
  1. Run tests (`tests/test_stroke_detection.py`) on every push or pull request.
  2. Check code style with a linter (e.g., flake8).
  3. Build and deploy documentation (future website integration).
- **Future Goals:**
  - Automate deployment of the web platform.
  - Run tests against real medical data (once integrated).

Stay tuned for updates as we implement CI!
