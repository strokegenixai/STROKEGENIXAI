# Deployment Plan

This folder outlines our plans for deploying the StrokeGenixAI model into production environments, ensuring healthcare providers can access our stroke detection capabilities.

## Planned Deployment Strategy
- **Environment:** Cloud-based deployment (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or a Solana-integrated platform).
- **Components:**
  1. **Web Platform:** Deploy a web interface for healthcare providers to input patient data and receive stroke risk predictions.
  2. **API:** Expose the StrokeDetectionModel as an API for integration with existing healthcare systems.
  3. **Solana Blockchain:** Deploy smart contracts to manage secure data storage and access permissions.
- **Steps:**
  1. Containerize the application using Docker for consistent deployment.
  2. Set up a CI/CD pipeline (see `ci/` folder) to automate deployment.
  3. Deploy the web platform and API to a cloud provider.
  4. Integrate with Solana for decentralized data management.

## Future Goals
- Ensure scalability to handle thousands of simultaneous users.
- Implement monitoring and logging for production reliability.
- Achieve compliance with healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA) for deployment in medical settings.

This is a work in progress, and we welcome contributions to help us build a robust deployment pipeline!
