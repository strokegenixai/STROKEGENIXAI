**STROKEGENIXAI** is an AI-powered platform designed to predict and prevent strokes by utilizing cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. Our system leverages AI models to analyze health data in real-time, detecting early signs of stroke risks and sending alerts for immediate medical intervention. This repository contains a simulated AI model that demonstrates the potential of our platform.

## **Project Overview**
Stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. Early detection is crucial for reducing stroke-related morbidity and mortality. STROKEGENIXAI addresses this challenge by using AI algorithms to predict stroke risks based on medical data and lifestyle factors. In combination with blockchain technology, we provide secure, transparent data handling for healthcare professionals.

## **Features**
- **Real-time Stroke Risk Detection**: AI-powered predictive analytics that assess stroke risk based on biometric data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ensures secure, immutable, and transparent storage of patient data, giving healthcare providers real-time access to important health information.
- **Real-time Alerts**: The system triggers alerts for high-risk patients, enabling early intervention.
- **Scalable**: The platform is designed to scale, making it adaptable to various healthcare systems and regions.

## **How It Works**
![Flowchart](https://github.com/strokegenixai/STROKEGENIXAI/blob/main/flowchart%20STROKEGENIXAI.jpg)
### **Data Collection**:
The AI model simulates the collection of key health indicators, such as:
- **Age**: Age plays a significant role in stroke risk.
- **Blood Pressure**: High blood pressure is a primary factor for stroke.
- **Cholesterol Levels**: Elevated cholesterol increases stroke risk.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, diabetes, and other factors contribute to stroke probability.

### **AI Model Simulation**:
The AI model processes these inputs to generate a **stroke risk score**. Based on the score, it classifies the risk as:
- **Low Risk**
- **Moderate Risk**
- **High Risk**

A **high-risk** score triggers an alert, indicating the need for immediate medical attention.

### **Blockchain Integration**:
Patient data is stored securely on the **Solana blockchain**, ensuring it is immutable and accessible by authorized healthcare providers. The use of blockchain enables real-time data sharing with enhanced security and transparency.

## **AI Model Simulation**

### **Code Overview**:
The AI model in this repository is written in Python. The file `stroke_detection_model.py` simulates the AI processing logic, including:
1. **Randomized Data Generation**: Generates random data for age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking, and diabetes.
2. **Risk Calculation**: Uses a simple scoring system to determine the stroke risk based on the generated data.
3. **Output**: Displays the stroke risk level in the console.

Here’s an example of how the model works:

```python
import random
import time

class StrokeDetectionModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = self.load_data()
    
    def load_data(self):
        # Simulate loading of health data
        return {
            "age": random.randint(20, 80),
            "blood_pressure": random.randint(110, 180),
            "cholesterol_level": random.randint(150, 250),
            "smoking": random.choice([True, False]),
            "diabetes": random.choice([True, False])
        }

    def predict_risk(self, data):
        risk_score = 0
        if data["age"] > 60:
            risk_score += 30
        if data["blood_pressure"] > 160:
            risk_score += 40
        if data["cholesterol_level"] > 240:
            risk_score += 20
        if data["smoking"]:
            risk_score += 25
        if data["diabetes"]:
            risk_score += 15
        
        return risk_score

    def run_model(self):
        print("Simulating stroke detection...")
        time.sleep(2)  # Simulate processing time
        
        risk = self.predict_risk(self.data)
        
        if risk > 80:
            print(f"Warning: High stroke risk detected! Risk Score: {risk}")
        elif 50 < risk <= 80:
            print(f"Moderate risk detected. Risk Score: {risk}")
        else:
            print(f"Low risk detected. Risk Score: {risk}")

# Simulate the AI model
if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = StrokeDetectionModel()
    model.run_model() 
```
### **Expected Output:***
Low Risk: "Low risk detected. Risk Score: 45"
Moderate Risk: "Moderate risk detected. Risk Score: 65"
High Risk: "Warning: High stroke risk detected! Risk Score: 95"

### **Future Work**
While the current repository includes a simulated AI model, we plan to implement the following in future versions:

Integration with Real Medical Data: Using actual patient data to train the AI model.
Model Improvement: Implementing more sophisticated machine learning models for better accuracy.
Web/Platform Integration: Building a full platform for healthcare providers to interact with the AI model and manage patient data.
